   The value of 'host' attribute of keyspace tag should match exactly what is in
   gora.properties file. Essentially this means that if you are using port number, you should
   use it every where regardless of whether it is the default port or not.
   At runtime Gora will otherwise try to connect to localhost
   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GORA-269

   The values of 'replication_factor' and 'placement_strategy' attribute of keyspace tag
   only apply if gora create the kyespace. they have no effect if this is being used against 
   an existing keyspace. the default value for 'replication_factor' is '1'
   
   The value of 'placement_strategy' should be a fully qualifed class name that is known to
   the cassansra cluster, not the application or gora. As of this writing, the classes that ship
   with cassandra are:
   'org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleStrategy'
   'org.apache.cassandra.locator.NetworkTopologyStrategy'
   gora cassandra would use SimpleStrategy by default if no value for this attribute is specified
   
   The default value of 'gc_grace_seconds' is '0' which is ONLY VIABLE FOR SINGLE NODE
   CLUSTER. you should update this value according to your cluster configuration. 
   https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/StorageConfiguration

   The value of 'ttl' (time to live) attribute of field tag should most likely always
   be zero unless you want Cassandra to create Tombstones and delete portions of your
   data once this period expires. Any positive value is read and bound to the number
   of seconds after which the value for that field will disappear. The default value of ttl
   is '0'
